{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Students will apply their knowledge of the causes of the American Revolution to create an interactive story via Twine. The interactive story will be based on the pre-revolutionary war period from the point of view of a loyalist or a patriot. As a warm-up students will look at an optical illusion picture and as a class discuss point of view and perspective. Students will work in heterogeneous pairs/groups to research, outline, and create a pre-revolutionary story about a patriot or loyalist.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Summarize the causes of the American Revolution</li>\n  <li>Construct a program to accomplish a task</li>\n  <li>Plan and research on a specified topic</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nsf-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/nsf.png\" alt=\"The NSF logo.\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2010256.
