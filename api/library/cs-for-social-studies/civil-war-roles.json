{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Students will work with a partner to pair-program a comparison of two different leaders and their role in the Civil War (Abraham Lincoln/Jefferson Davis, Ulysses S. Grant/Robert E. Lee, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson/Frederick Douglass) using Twinery.org. Their product must also incorporate and attribute existing digital media (i.e.images). Students will then find a partner group that selected different figures and peer review their Twine product with emphasis on usability, content, language, user perspective, image layout/attribution and ease of use. The feedback given must be addressed and incorporated. Students will then complete a Partner Evaluation form to review their experience working with pair programming.</p>\n<p>This lesson can be divided into two class periods if necessary.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Describe the roles of Civil War leaders before and during the war.</li>\n  <li>Describe how opposing views led to conflict</li>\n  <li>Work with peers to review and adjust programs.</li>\n  <li>Incorporate feedback into the design of a product.</li>\n  <li>Integrate digital media from other sources and give attribution.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nsf-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/nsf.png\" alt=\"The NSF logo.\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2010256.
