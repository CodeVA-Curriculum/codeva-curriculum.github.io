{"content":"\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>This cryptography lesson set immerses students in the fascinating world of cryptography and its profound historical influence on modern cybersecurity. Designed as a series of integrated mini-lessons, this curriculum offers educators a versatile toolkit for guiding students through the captivating landscape of early United States history (pre-1865). The lessons serve as a captivating exploration into how cryptography has significantly shaped historical events and impacted the lives of Americans. These mini-lessons also showcase how different modalities of cryptography were used, including written, auditory and visual signals, with many examples of steganography (hidden in plain sight).</p>\n<p>These classroom-ready mini-lessons present tangible examples of cryptography's progression in sophistication and security throughout history. Importantly, these lessons offer a compelling entry point into the realm of cybersecurity, a domain within computer science that might initially seem daunting to educators. The curriculum ensures alignment with relevant educational standards, embraces Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles, and incorporates culturally relevant and sustaining education practices, enhancing the accessibility and inclusivity of the learning experience. Through these mini-lessons, both educators and students gain valuable insights into the intricate world of cryptography, its pivotal role in history, and its lasting impact on modern-day cybersecurity practices. This flexibility empowers educators to seamlessly integrate one, several, or all of the mini-lessons, culminating in an engaging breakout activity that reflects the lessons covered.</p>\n<div class=\"nsf-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/nsf.png\" alt=\"The NSF logo.\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2010256.
