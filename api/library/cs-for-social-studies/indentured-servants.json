{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will organize and visualize data from indentured contract databases from virtualjamestown.org in order to come to some conclusions about the characteristics of indentured servants in early colonial America. They will make specific decisions about how to organize the data and how to best visualize the data. They will then use the data to draw conclusions about indentured servants in early colonial Virginia, culminating in a creative journal entry assignment. Additional lessons can have students search for and analyze data on the enslaved Africans of early colonial Virginia in order to compare and contrast the two forms of labor in colonial Virginia.</p>\n<div class=\"nsf-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/nsf.png\" alt=\"The NSF logo.\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2010256.
