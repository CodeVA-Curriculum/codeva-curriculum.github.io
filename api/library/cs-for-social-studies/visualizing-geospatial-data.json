{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This activity will ask students to locate geographic regions and features on a class map using longitude and latitude measurements. Using the longitude and latitude data, students will be able to visualize geographic features in the actual location in order to analyze the living conditions of various regions.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Differentiate between longitude and latitude measurements</li>\n  <li>Use longitude and latitude coordinates to locate specific places and to visualize the comparative sizes of geographic features and regions.</li>\n  <li>Make hypotheses about relative living conditions based on geographic data.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"nsf-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/nsf.png\" alt=\"The NSF logo.\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2010256.
