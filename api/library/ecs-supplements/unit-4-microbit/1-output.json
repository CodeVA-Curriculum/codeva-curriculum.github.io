{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students learn the basics of coding for the Micro:Bit using the MakeCode development tool. Students will engage in PRIMM cycles, pair programming, and will begin working on the puzzle box they’ll finish in later lessons by building an “unlocking” animation using display output blocks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: This lesson is adapted from the Algorithms lesson from the CS Intro curriculum by Microsoft, with permission.
