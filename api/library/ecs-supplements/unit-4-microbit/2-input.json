{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will learn how to make interactive programs using input event blocks, the MakeCode development tool, and the Micro:Bit microcontroller. Students will work collaboratively to explore different methods of providing input to the Micro:Bit, and will create a “fidget cube” puzzle box prototype which will serve as a starting point for their “lockbox” puzzles (see <a href=\"/library/browse/ecs-supplements/unit-4-microbit/4-conditionals\">Conditionals with Micro:Bit</a> for the “lockbox” project description).</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: The “Fidget Cube” Lockbox Puzzle Prototype project is adapted from the Algorithms lesson from Microsoft’s CS Intro curriculum (with permission).
