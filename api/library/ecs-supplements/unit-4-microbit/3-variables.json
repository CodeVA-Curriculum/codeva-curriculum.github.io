{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This lesson introduces the use of variables to store data or the results of mathematical operations. Students will practice giving variables unique and meaningful names. At the end of the lesson, students will practice using variables by creating a “scorekeeping” program, using the Micro:Bit to keep track of the score for a game.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: This lesson is adapted from the Variables lesson in Microsoft’s CS Intro curriculum (with permission).
