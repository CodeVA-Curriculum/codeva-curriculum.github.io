{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will learn how to write conditional control structures (e..g, “if” statements) to have a Micro:Bit make automated decisions based on sensor input. At the end of the lesson, students will use these skills to build a “lockbox” puzzle for their peers to solve.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: This lesson is adapted from the Conditionals lesson in Microsoft’s CS Intro curriculum (with permission).
