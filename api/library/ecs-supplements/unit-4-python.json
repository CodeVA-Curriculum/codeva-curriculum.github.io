{"content":"\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>CodeVAâ€™s ECS+Python lesson materials are collections of lesson plans and resources designed to help Virginia teachers facilitate computer science instruction where students learn to read, trace, debug, and write Python programs.</p>\n<p>We have designed the ECS+Python lesson materials to be a drop-in replacement for Units 4 &#x26; 5 of the Exploring Computer Science curriculum. The sections below provide pacing guides for the materials.
