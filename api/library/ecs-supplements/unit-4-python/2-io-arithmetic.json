{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will read and trace a “Hello World'' Python program to learn how to display simple output. Then, they will create an “Addition Calculator” to learn how to work with variables and arithmetic operators. At the end, students will modify and complete partially-written Python programs, applying their knowledge of variables and arithmetic operations.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Read, trace, debug, and write Python programs that:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Perform arithmetic operations variables</li>\n      <li>Take user input and store them in variables</li>\n      <li>Generate formatted output based on user input</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Write arithmetic expressions using Python &#x26; predict the results of those expressions</li>\n  <li>Identify input &#x26; output in programs they use in daily life, and evaluate the ways those programs use the data they provide to them</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
