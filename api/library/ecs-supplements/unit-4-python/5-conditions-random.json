{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will explore the “Testing Random Numbers” program to learn how to generate random numbers and use if-statements to make comparisons. Then, they will create a “Roll the Dice Game” to learn how to work conditionals and random numbers. At the end, students will create a simple program applying their knowledge of randomization and conditional control structures.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Read, debug, and write Python programs that:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Generate random numbers</li>\n      <li>Use conditional statements to produce multiple output statements</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Consider the role of automation in society, including computing systems that automate tasks through conditional control structures &#x26; data entry/collection</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"5.
