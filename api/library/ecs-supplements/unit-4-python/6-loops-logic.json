{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will implement Python programs that use “while” loops and logical operations as they consider how they might make their programs more interactive and control the flow of commands in their programs. They’ll read and modify examples, explore the new concepts through paired programming, and complete a short mini-project where they will demonstrate their new skills.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Read, debug, and write Python programs that:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Generate random numbers</li>\n      <li>Use “if” statements to produce multiple output statements</li>\n      <li>Combine conditional statements using logic operators</li>\n      <li>Use “while” loops</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Consider the role of programs that use conditional statements in the reinforcement of systemic injustice, marginalization, or other problems exacerbated by poor design decisions in automated computing systems</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
