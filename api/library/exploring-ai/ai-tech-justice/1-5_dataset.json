{"content":"\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students learn about the basics of data. Through a survey, they collect data, analyze it, and understand the limitations of data and data collection. They will connect their key takeaways from their real-world experiences with data collection to prepare to analyze AI scenarios.</p>\n<p>This lesson was created by Holly Sawyer and edited by Michelle Pealo for CodeVA with support from the Kapor Center.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Exploring a Dataset","authors":"Holly Sawyer, Michelle Pealo","standards":["8.CS24.DA.2","8.CS24.IC.1"],"subjects":["Computer Science"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"_tags":"data, dataset","links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RkG3FsWsTE2DNYIZF0-0g5HghHNzsvRtadaAqi6WWUU/edit?usp=sharing","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I-XBXA7tGH_ESM0eSoICUmd673v7mtMV/view?usp=drive_link"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"exploring-ai/ai-tech-justice/1-5_dataset.md"},"grades":["8-9"],"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["AI","machine learning","data"," dataset"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"ai.jpg","parents":[{"title":"AI & Tech Justice","authors":"Michelle Pealo, Amber Rauls-Drayer, Holly Sawyer, Jess Newsome, Jon Stapleton","standards":"8.CS24.DA.2, 8.CS24.IC.1, HS.CSF.IC.1, HS.CSF.DA.3, HS.CSP.DA.3, HS.CSP.DA.4","subjects":"Computer Science, Mathematics, Music, History & Social Science, English","grades":"8-9","_tags":"ethics, tech justice","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BdZpDI7A4Oqxu1XXO24wIV7Li7LKom2"},"contents":["./1_role_of_data.md","./1-5_dataset.md","./2_bias_in_ai.md","./3_teachable_machine.md","./4a_ai_frankenstein.md","./4b_ai_math.md","./4c_ai_music.md","./5_ethical_use.md"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/exploring-ai/ai-tech-justice/meta.md"}},{"title":"Exploring AI","image":"ai.jpg","grades":"K-12","subjects":"Computer Science","audiences":"Classroom Teachers, Curriculum Writers","types":"Curricular Resource, Lesson Plan","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T-zSgYpMxSWRW2cL40ErU9RpU8GctSi7"},"tags":"AI, machine learning","contents":["./ai-tech-justice","./teachable-machine.md","./ai-sol-crosswalk.md"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/exploring-ai/meta.md"}}],"members":[]}}
