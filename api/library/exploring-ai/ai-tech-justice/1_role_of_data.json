{"content":"\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students learn about artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the importance of quality data. Through interactive activities like sorting examples of AI and predicting patterns, students explore how AI makes decisions and the role of data in those decisions. They will identify AI in their daily lives, discuss how flawed data can affect outcomes, and reflect on ethical considerations.</p>\n<p>This lesson was created by Amber Rauls-Drayer and edited by Michelle Pealo for CodeVA with support from the Kapor Center.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"What is the Role of Data?","authors":"Amber Rauls-Drayer, Michelle Pealo","subjects":["Computer Science"],"standards":["8.CS24.DA.2","8.CS24.IC.1"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"_tags":"artificial intelligence, AI, ethics, data","links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19GK5bu0Tkk1PQVXm5P8ZzXyC84imdIVACBJmDxTsddQ/edit?usp=sharing","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XHngErrT4n7aEo1wJJ-qY8c2YjOn_tvu/view?usp=drive_link"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"exploring-ai/ai-tech-justice/1_role_of_data.md"},"grades":["8-9"],"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["AI","machine learning","artificial intelligence"," AI"," ethics"," data"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"ai.jpg","parents":[{"title":"AI & Tech Justice","authors":"Michelle Pealo, Amber Rauls-Drayer, Holly Sawyer, Jess Newsome, Jon Stapleton","standards":"8.CS24.DA.2, 8.CS24.IC.1, HS.CSF.IC.1, HS.CSF.DA.3, HS.CSP.DA.3, HS.CSP.DA.4","subjects":"Computer Science, Mathematics, Music, History & Social Science, English","grades":"8-9","_tags":"ethics, tech justice","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BdZpDI7A4Oqxu1XXO24wIV7Li7LKom2"},"contents":["./1_role_of_data.md","./1-5_dataset.md","./2_bias_in_ai.md","./3_teachable_machine.md","./4a_ai_frankenstein.md","./4b_ai_math.md","./4c_ai_music.md","./5_ethical_use.md"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/exploring-ai/ai-tech-justice/meta.md"}},{"title":"Exploring AI","image":"ai.jpg","grades":"K-12","subjects":"Computer Science","audiences":"Classroom Teachers, Curriculum Writers","types":"Curricular Resource, Lesson Plan","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T-zSgYpMxSWRW2cL40ErU9RpU8GctSi7"},"tags":"AI, machine learning","contents":["./ai-tech-justice","./teachable-machine.md","./ai-sol-crosswalk.md"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/exploring-ai/meta.md"}}],"members":[]}}
