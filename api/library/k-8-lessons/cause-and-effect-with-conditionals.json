They will then read a story and use a Scratch programming conditionals worksheet to identify the if-then/cause-effect relationships from the story. Students will then apply their knowledge of conditionals to sketch their own program using Scratch blocks that includes at least one conditional.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify examples of cause and effect relationships in real life</li>\n  <li>Identify conditionals in a story</li>\n  <li>Apply conditionals to a Scratch program</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Cause and Effect with Conditionals","authors":"Allison Kappler, Tara Lockhart, Deborah Diner, Sarah Weir","grades":["3"],"subjects":["Computer Science","Science"],"standards":["5.CS.AP.2","5.EN.RD.5"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"_tags":"STEAM, conditionals, cause and effect, relationships, unplugged","links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1awm8U5byGCeFHMp_qpw8azIv1adKJubkeA5EC_-bbnw/edit?usp=drive_link","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1inYAREUe7ou1Q-ULAv59pfLcmQuqKz4B/view?usp=drive_link"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"k-8-lessons/cause-and-effect-with-conditionals.md"},"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["integration","k-8","lessons","computer science","STEAM"," conditionals"," cause and effect"," relationships"," unplugged"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Students","Administrators","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"default.png","parents":[{"title":"K-8 Lesson Plan","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EKU_Gz21tkQfQAsZZK4PeI0MW0HUx4VH"},"tags":"integration, k-8, lessons, computer science","pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/k-8-lessons/.meta.md"},"vdoe":false}],"members":[]}}
