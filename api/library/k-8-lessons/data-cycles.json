{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This lesson introduces students to the data cycle and uses line plots (dot plots) and stem-and-leaf plots to represent data. Students formulate questions, collect data from peers, and then organize it into graphical representations. They analyze the data to identify trends, make predictions, and draw conclusions, emphasizing the importance of data interpretation.</p>\n<p><em>Click the <code>Google Drive</code> button above to view the whole lesson!</em></p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Formulate questions that require data collection.</li>\n  <li>Collect and organize data using line plots (dot plots) and stem-and-leaf plots.</li>\n  <li>Analyze data to draw conclusions and make predictions.</li>\n  <li>Propose solutions or follow-up questions based on data analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Cycles","authors":"Amber Rauls-Drayer, Jess Newsome, Jon Stapleton","grades":["5"],"subjects":["Computer Science","Mathematics"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gWNQsl32ccTP-OVCgjn7FKSDlZAmOd7Xg0cuNxRXXXI/edit"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"k-8-lessons/data-cycles.md"},"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["integration","k-8","lessons","computer science"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Students","Administrators","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"default.png","parents":[{"title":"K-8 Lesson Plan","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EKU_Gz21tkQfQAsZZK4PeI0MW0HUx4VH"},"tags":"integration, k-8, lessons, computer science","pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/k-8-lessons/.meta.md"},"vdoe":false}],"members":[]}}
