{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Students will identify living and nonliving things in a Virginia woodland ecosystem and create a sample food chain. Students will create conditional statements about their food chain, then write an algorithm using pseudocode to identify the steps of the food chain on paper.</p>\n<p><em>Click the <code>Google Drive</code> button above to view the whole lesson!</em></p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Describe living and nonliving components in an ecosystem</li>\n  <li>Differentiate among producers, consumers and decomposers in an ecosystem</li>\n  <li>Explain how a change in one part of a food chain might affect the rest of the food chain</li>\n  <li>Describe the concept of a conditional control structure</li>\n  <li>Read &#x26; write an algorithm that includes conditional control structures using pseudocode</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Food Chain Algorithms","authors":"Allison Kappler, Jon Stapleton","grades":["3"],"subjects":["Computer Science","Science"],"standards":["3.CS.AP.2","3.SC.LP.5"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NNnWXrd5p8tU29M0L1M_lBuXGGJXRczbqOvGy-ZsOQ/edit"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"k-8-lessons/food-chain-algorithms.md"},"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["integration","k-8","lessons","computer science"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Students","Administrators","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"default.png","parents":[{"title":"K-8 Lesson Plan","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EKU_Gz21tkQfQAsZZK4PeI0MW0HUx4VH"},"tags":"integration, k-8, lessons, computer science","pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/k-8-lessons/.meta.md"},"vdoe":false}],"members":[]}}
