{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this project, students will demonstrate their understanding of probability and of various coding skills to create a probability-based game whose difficulty changes with changes in probability. Students will use a project design menu to build their project.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Calculate, by hand, the probability of random events</li>\n  <li>Create a Micro:Bit simulation to test probability</li>\n  <li>Use “if” statements in code</li>\n  <li>Analyze the differences between theoretical and experimental probability</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
