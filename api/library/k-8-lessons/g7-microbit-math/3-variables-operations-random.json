{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students learn fundamental coding skills on the Micro:Bit, specifically focusing on conditionals, variables and randomization. Through hands-on activities, students will learn to modify and create programs, establishing a foundation for upcoming lessons on conditionals.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Apply the concept of variables on the Micro:Bit, recognizing their role in storing and manipulating data.</li>\n  <li>Use randomization in their Micro:Bit programs.</li>\n  <li>Establish connections between input/event blocks and variables, enabling the creation of interactive programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
