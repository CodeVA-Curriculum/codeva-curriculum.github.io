{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will learn probability concepts, recognizing and describing them within the context of a Micro:Bit simulation. By manipulating code, students will apply the concept of probability as decimals, gaining hands-on experience with the Micro:Bit. Additionally, they will analyze and compare theoretical and experimental probabilities, fostering a beginning understanding of the interplay between mathematical principles and real-world simulations.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Recognize and describe basic probability concepts.</li>\n  <li>Apply the concept of probability as decimals using a Micro:Bit.</li>\n  <li>Analyze and compare theoretical and experimental probability.</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"8.
