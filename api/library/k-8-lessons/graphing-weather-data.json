{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Students work in groups to use four weather tools (thermometer, barometer, anemometer, rain gauge) to collect weather data. Students then look up historical weather data for a specific location and record the data in a chart and create a line graph to represent the historical data over the last 10 years.</p>\n<p><em>Click the <code>Google Drive</code> button above to view the whole lesson!</em></p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Analyze and report data on temperature, precipitation, and wind speed</li>\n  <li>Use weather instruments (thermometer, barometer, rain gauge, anemometer) and observations of sky conditions to collect, record, and graph weather data over time; analyze results and determine patterns that may be used to make weather predictions</li>\n  <li>Collect data to create charts and graphs</li>\n  <li>Recognize and analyze patterns and relationships within data sets</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Graphing Weather Data","authors":"Allison Kappler, Jon Stapleton","grades":["4"],"subjects":["Computer Science","Science"],"standards":["4.SC.SE.1","4.SC.ES.4"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gKD_dIMzm_o9hPKD_JUJSuFAQ4L5dkxib9rWE286_zY/edit"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"k-8-lessons/graphing-weather-data.md"},"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["integration","k-8","lessons","computer science"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Students","Administrators","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"default.png","parents":[{"title":"K-8 Lesson Plan","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EKU_Gz21tkQfQAsZZK4PeI0MW0HUx4VH"},"tags":"integration, k-8, lessons, computer science","pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/k-8-lessons/.meta.md"}}],"members":[]}}
