{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students analyze characteristics and stages of a plant life cycle. Using a set of cards identifying different plants and the stages of their life cycles, students use computational thinking skills to compare and contrast features of each plantâ€™s life cycle. Students will sort the life cycles according to different features identified, then create an algorithm to be able to categorize plants based on their life cycle attributes.</p>\n<p><em>Click the <code>Google Drive</code> button above to view the whole lesson!</em></p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify key parts of a plant life cycle including seed, germination of the seed, growth of the stem and roots, growth of leaves, growth of flowers, fertilization (pollination) of the flowers, production of fruit/new seeds, and death.</li>\n  <li>Compare and contrast multiple ways to sort plant life cycles</li>\n  <li>Create a table of features to organize plant life cycles</li>\n  <li>Design an algorithm to sort plant life cycles into categories based on multiple attributes</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
