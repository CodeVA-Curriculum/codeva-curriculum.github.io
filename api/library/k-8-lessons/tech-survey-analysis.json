{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will discuss some positive and negative impacts of device usage on students. They will then design survey questions to investigate how device usage varies by individuals and how it may impact their lives. Students will conduct a survey, design graphs to discuss their findings and analyze their data to identify patterns and potential relationships between device usage and other points of interest.</p>\n<p><em>Click the <code>Google Drive</code> button above to view the whole lesson!</em></p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to . . .</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Conduct a survey about the effects of using computing devices daily.</li>\n  <li>Create and compare two different visual representations of their survey data.</li>\n  <li>Analyze data representations to recognize patterns, make predictions, and draw conclusions.</li>\n  <li>Examine and discuss the positive and negative impacts of computing technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
