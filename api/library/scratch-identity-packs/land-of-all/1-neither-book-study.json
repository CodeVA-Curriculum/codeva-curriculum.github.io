{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students do a matching activity to introduce vocabulary relevant to <em>Neither</em> by Airlie Anderson and the themes throughout the story. Students will discuss these concepts while reading the book, followed by a comparison activity that contrasts the two “lands” in the story. Building on the <em>Land of All</em> activities, students will discuss and practice how to properly ask and use someone’s pronouns. Finally, students will create a cartoon in order to practice asking someone which pronouns they prefer.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"1. \"Neither\" Book Study","authors":"Amber Rauls-Drayer, Jasper Gunn, Jon Stapleton","links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dgdnxgleuSWs0JEdaQTJTV16Ty8fAZ9jlW72prvHxjw/edit?usp=drive_link"},"types":["Lesson Plan"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"scratch-identity-packs/land-of-all/1-neither-book-study.md"},"subjects":["Computer Science","English","Social-Emotional Learning"],"grades":["3-5"],"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["scratch","integration","ela","writing","coding","literature"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Students","Administrators","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"land-cover.png","parents":[{"title":"The Land of All","authors":"Amber Rauls-Drayer, Michelle Pealo, Jasper Gunn, Jon Stapleton","grades":"3-5","types":"Unit of Study, Lesson Plan","image":"land-cover.png","links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLloIJU2yZGgw9lMBOTWpOBVDaJL6bFDQKewpjC7Dv4/edit?usp=drive_link","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Z3FS5lEMf0QgA5p5nAvMIRkeo_Ki7laX","goopen":"https://goopenva.org/courseware/lesson/6591"},"contents":["./0-teacher-considerations.md","./1-neither-book-study.md","./2-land-of-all-sprite.md","./3-high-five.md","./4-lands-i-move-through.md"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/scratch-identity-packs/land-of-all/meta.md"}},{"title":"Exploring Identity with Scratch","authors":"Jasper Gunn, Michelle Pealo, Amber Rauls-Drayer, Jon Stapleton","grades":"3-5","subjects":"Computer Science, English, Social-Emotional Learning","types":"Curricular Resource, Unit of Study","tags":"scratch, integration, ela, writing, coding, literature","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jc_n7wqbXYj0_MmTP7KJK2E9oZqxp1EE"},"contents":["./whats-in-a-name","./land-of-all","./many-colors-of-us"],"image":"scratch-identity.jpg","pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/scratch-identity-packs/meta.md"}}],"members":[]}}
