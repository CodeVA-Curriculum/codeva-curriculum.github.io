{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will code along with the teacher to create a chase-style game in which the main sprite “high fives” its friends. Students will learn to use conditional blocks and Boolean blocks to control actions in the program, and will practice using variables to have the computer count how many times an action has occurred in the game.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"High-Five Friends Game","authors":"Michelle Pealo, Jasper Gunn, Jon Stapleton","links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14T_n_89EgG2XnE5Kootok1maQiEd8W1R0dbQBl0OouE/edit#heading=h.joty0v63l5oi"},"types":["Lesson Plan"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"scratch-identity-packs/land-of-all/3-high-five.md"},"subjects":["Computer Science","English","Social-Emotional Learning"],"grades":["3-5"],"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["scratch","integration","ela","writing","coding","literature"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Students","Administrators","Curriculum Writers"],"image":"land-cover.png","parents":[{"title":"The Land of All","authors":"Amber Rauls-Drayer, Michelle Pealo, Jasper Gunn, Jon Stapleton","grades":"3-5","types":"Unit of Study, Lesson Plan","image":"land-cover.png","links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLloIJU2yZGgw9lMBOTWpOBVDaJL6bFDQKewpjC7Dv4/edit?usp=drive_link","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Z3FS5lEMf0QgA5p5nAvMIRkeo_Ki7laX","goopen":"https://goopenva.org/courseware/lesson/6591"},"contents":["./0-teacher-considerations.md","./1-neither-book-study.md","./2-land-of-all-sprite.md","./3-high-five.md","./4-lands-i-move-through.md"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/scratch-identity-packs/land-of-all/meta.md"}},{"title":"Exploring Identity with Scratch","authors":"Jasper Gunn, Michelle Pealo, Amber Rauls-Drayer, Jon Stapleton","grades":"3-5","subjects":"Computer Science, English, Social-Emotional Learning","types":"Curricular Resource, Unit of Study","tags":"scratch, integration, ela, writing, coding, literature","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jc_n7wqbXYj0_MmTP7KJK2E9oZqxp1EE"},"contents":["./whats-in-a-name","./land-of-all","./many-colors-of-us"],"image":"scratch-identity.jpg","pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/scratch-identity-packs/meta.md"}}],"members":[]}}
