{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This project prompts fourth and fifth grade students to create four “lands'' using Scratch, one of which being an inclusive “Land of All” as described in <em>Neither</em> by Airlie Anderson (see the <a href=\"/library/browse/scratch-identity-packs/land-of-all/1-neither-book-study\"><em>Neither</em> Book Study lesson</a> from the beginning of the sequence). The students will reflect on what they love and what they find difficult about each “land” (i.e., social context) they move through in their lives. Using the sprite they created in a previous lesson, the students will build a program that tells the story of each “land they move through”.</p>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
