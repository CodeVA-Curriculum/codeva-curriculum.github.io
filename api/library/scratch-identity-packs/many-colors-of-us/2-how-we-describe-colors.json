{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will describe color using adjectives and nouns, apply vocabulary from visual arts (including hue, value, and intensity) to refine their descriptions, and learn about how computers represent color information. They will compare and contrast the ways which humans and computers describe color, select the method of describing they prefer, and defend their selection. In examining the strengths and weaknesses of each method, students may come to an understanding that different methods of describing color may be better than others depending on the situation.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Describe colors using adjectives and nouns</li>\n  <li>Express color using numeric values</li>\n  <li>Describe the relationship between the way humans describe color and the way computers describe color</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"2.
