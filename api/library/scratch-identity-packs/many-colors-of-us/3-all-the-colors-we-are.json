{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>The lesson is designed to help fourth and fifth grade students understand the scientific relationship between melanin and skin color. It includes a vocabulary scavenger hunt, hands-on activities to demonstrate the impact of the sun on skin color, reading a story, creating a journal entry, and collaborating on a classroom mural. The goal is to promote a more accurate and unbiased understanding of skin color by providing factual information about the role of melanin in protecting the skin from the sun. This approach aims to counter myths and stereotypes surrounding skin color and promote a more inclusive learning environment.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Locate their ancestral origins on a map and explain the relationship between climate and skin tone.</li>\n  <li>Create a journal entry demonstrating their understanding of the role of melanin in protecting the skin from the sun.</li>\n  <li>Participate in creating a classroom mural that represents the diversity of their ancestry.</li>\n  <li>Recognize and value the thoughts and feelings of others by asking questions and listening to those with different perspectives, backgrounds, and cultures.</li>\n  <li>Demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between melanin concentration and skin color, and the chemical reaction between the sun and melanin through a hands-on activity.</li>\n  <li>Understand and use scientific and engineering practices to come up with and evaluate explanations and conclusions.</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"3.
