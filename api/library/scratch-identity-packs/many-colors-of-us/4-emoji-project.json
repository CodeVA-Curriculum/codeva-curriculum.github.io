{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this lesson, students will begin by analyzing the code of an existing “emoji pen” sprite, identifying areas of the code which control specific actions and details to portray a given emotion. They will then plan their own “emoji pen” sprite to portray a different emotion, modify the code of the sample sprite to create this sprite, and export and share the sprite to be used in a class project. After the teacher imports the sprites into a shared class project, students will work in small groups to identify the feelings represented by each sprite and discuss both the feelings expressed and the programming skills used to express these emotions.</p>\n<h2>Objectives:</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Analyze an “emoji pen” sprite in Scratch and modify the sprite with code that reflects a specific feeling or emotion.</li>\n  <li>Apply numeric variables (hex code) to determine the skin color used in the emoji.</li>\n  <li>Use sequencing, loops, and/or if statements to animate the emoji.</li>\n  <li>Collaborate in pairs or small groups to identify their own “emoji pen” sprite and to identify the emotions portrayed by other classmates’ sprites in a collaborative Scratch project.</li>\n</ul>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"4.
