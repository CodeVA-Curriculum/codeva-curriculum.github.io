{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Students will use Scratch programming to create interactive poems inspired by <em>The Skin I'm In</em> by Sharon G. Flake and other poems. This project is designed with the aim of creating a safe and supportive learning environment for students to explore their own identity and sense of self through examining otherâ€™s writing and reflecting on their own experiences. Students will explore the elements of poetry, experiment with different programming features, and practice their public speaking and presentation skills.</p>\n<h2>Objectives</h2>\n<p><em>The students will be able to...</em></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Apply the basics of Scratch programming language to an expressive project</li>\n  <li>Develop an understanding of poetic elements (e.g., metaphor, simile, imagery, rhyme)</li>\n  <li>Explore and express their own identity and sense of self</li>\n  <li>Develop creativity and self-expression through writing and coding</li>\n  <li>Develop public speaking and presentation skills</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"supporter-disclaimer\">\n  <div class=\"img-wrap\">\n    <img src=\"/images/donate.png\">\n  </div>\n  <p class=\"text\">CodeVA created this material with support from a private donor.
