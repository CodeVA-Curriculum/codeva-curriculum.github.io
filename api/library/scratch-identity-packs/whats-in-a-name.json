{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This lesson sequence offers students and teachers a way to explore gender and cultural identity through analyzing childrenâ€™s literature and coding with Scratch, specifically exploring the importance of names to our identities. Through read-aloud activities and self-differentiated Scratch projects, students learn about the importance of names in reference to both gender identity and culture, and have a chance to explore and express ideas about their own names, brainstorm creating school environments supportive of diversity, and reflect on their own bravery and resilience.</p>\n<p>This sequence is broken into seven lessons, though your students may need additional class time to work on their projects.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"What's In a Name?","authors":"Jasper Gunn, Michelle Pealo, Amber Rauls-Drayer, Matthew Reirson, Jon Stapleton","grades":["3-5"],"image":"name_jar_stamp.png","types":["Unit of Study"],"links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ka5czon_fe5O1LaPiHnPegaTSomaMRF4QtUnMkeN-C4/edit?usp=drive_link","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jMWb-AjY5BhSouaLERwlAP5zCC8kn7bw/view?usp=drive_link","goopen":"https://goopenva.org/courseware/lesson/6216"},"contents":["./0-teacher-considerations.md","./1-calvin-book-study.md","./2-identity-puzzle.md","./3-who-am-i.md","./4-the-name-jar.md","./5-friend-stamps.md","./6-pronouncing-names.md","./7-super-me.md"],"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"scratch-identity-packs/whats-in-a-name/meta.md"},"subjects":["Computer Science","English","Social-Emotional Learning"],"license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["scratch","integration","ela","writing","coding","literature"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers","Students","Administrators","Curriculum Writers"],"parents":[{"title":"Exploring Identity with Scratch","authors":"Jasper Gunn, Michelle Pealo, Amber Rauls-Drayer, Jon Stapleton","grades":"3-5","subjects":"Computer Science, English, Social-Emotional Learning","types":"Curricular Resource, Unit of Study","tags":"scratch, integration, ela, writing, coding, literature","links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jc_n7wqbXYj0_MmTP7KJK2E9oZqxp1EE"},"contents":["./whats-in-a-name","./land-of-all","./many-colors-of-us"],"image":"scratch-identity.jpg","pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/scratch-identity-packs/meta.md"}}],"members":[{"title":"0.
