{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Recently, childrenâ€™s literature centering on identity has been subject to intense scrutiny, and even attack. Some may fear that children will be encouraged to identify or act in a specific way simply by reading books like Calvin, which is about a transgender child, but this is a myth.
