{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p><em>The Name Jar</em> is a book about a child finding her voice and grappling with her identity after moving from Korea to America. In this lesson, you will discuss cultural identity, differences and a celebration of those differences before, during and after reading the book aloud to your students. You will work with students to develop vocabulary that will help them better articulate their thoughts during the read aloud discussions. Activities focused on reading comprehension and social-emotional learning include a story map, a character comparison activity and journal prompts.</p>\n<p>Lesson 4 of 7 in the <a href=\"/library/browse/scratch-identity-packs/whats-in-a-name\">Whatâ€™s in a Name?
