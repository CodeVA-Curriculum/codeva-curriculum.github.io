{"content":"\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In this project, students will create a Scratch project exploring names as an aspect of cultural identity. The students will view names from around the world and pick three from a given list. They will research the names’ pronunciations and meanings in order to showcase this information in a Scratch project. Timing for the project will be programmed using say and sound blocks. The students can further challenge themselves by making the programs interactive using events.</p>\n<p>Lesson 6 of 7 in the <a href=\"/library/browse/scratch-identity-packs/whats-in-a-name\">What’s in a Name?
