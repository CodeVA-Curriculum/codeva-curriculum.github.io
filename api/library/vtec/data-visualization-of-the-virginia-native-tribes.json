{"content":"\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Students will research one of the seven federally recognized tribes of Native Americans in Virginia to identify local features of the land, their language, the region of Virginia where they originally lived, where the tribal lands are today, and how they interacted with their environment. From this research, the student groups will design a visualization of this data using a poster, online design tool, or a presentation. Student groups will present their information to each other, and the classroom will design a chart to find similarities and differences between the tribes. This lesson was created through a partnership between CodeVA and the Virginia Tribal Education Consortium (VTEC).</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Data Visualization of the Virginia Native tribes","subjects":["Computer Science","History & Social Science"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers"],"grades":["4"],"_tags":"computer science, data visualization, native americans, virginia native tribes, virginia studies","standards":["4.CS.DA.12","4.VS.VP.2"],"links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nY1ACLedFU7EYzTxUvRJ5v_hDPlbfNcBBwNhFL-enr8/edit#heading=h.joty0v63l5oi","goopen":"https://goopenva.org/courseware/lesson/6207/overview","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ndCfKXBvXIB9Zxi3JPuuZZOK0xdMasOl/view?usp=drive_link"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"vtec/data-visualization-of-the-virginia-native-tribes.md"},"authors":"CodeVA Curriculum","license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["tribal education","VTEC","computer science"," data visualization"," native americans"," virginia native tribes"," virginia studies"],"image":"default.png","parents":[{"title":"Indigenous Representation & Presence in CS","subjects":"Computer Science, English, Science, History & Social Science","types":"Lesson Plan","grades":"4-8","tags":"tribal education, VTEC","contents":["./fry-bread.md","./chickahominy-land.md","./data-visualization-of-the-virginia-native-tribes.md","./go-show-the-world.md","./impacts-of-westward-expansion.md","./perspectives-on-the-dakota-access-pipeline.md","./rappahannock's-return-to-the-river.md","./remember.md","./treaties.md","./water-walker.md","./young-water-protectors.md"],"links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gBc8BCT4s1F7Pb6FTMLpka2NOa6UnX2D"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/vtec/meta.md"}}],"members":[]}}
