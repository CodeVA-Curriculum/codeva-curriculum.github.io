{"content":"\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>This lesson takes students through the examination of the poem Remember and its use of figurative language to set the stage for considering how the physical world around us has changed in the past 50 years. Students research a specific local plant, animal, or element of weather and how it has changed over time, and then use Twine to represent their research in a digital story. This lesson culminates with the discussion of whether or not we are doing a good job of listening to Virginiaâ€™s natural elements over the past 50 years. This lesson was created through a partnership between CodeVA and the Virginia Tribal Education Consortium (VTEC).</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Remember - Indigenous Perspective on Environmentalism","subjects":["Computer Science","English","History & Social Science"],"types":["Lesson Plan"],"audiences":["Classroom Teachers"],"grades":["8"],"_tags":"environmentalism, figurative language, human impact, indigenous, native American, programming, twine","standards":["8.CS.AP.1","8.EN.COM.1","8.EN.RD.5","8.EN.RE.9","8.WG.ING.1","8.WG.RE.2"],"links":{"drive":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eml3mB31ggemvxTG5-Hhk_KHULHMvdAivFCJ8PUv9mQ/edit?usp=drive_link","goopen":"https://goopenva.org/courseware/lesson/5993/overview","pdf":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kerS9XPOk5f0dx5WqHj4jFZmlunRPxe2/view?usp=drive_link"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"vtec/remember.md"},"authors":"CodeVA Curriculum","license":{"name":"CC-BY-NC-SA","link":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"},"tags":["tribal education","VTEC","environmentalism"," figurative language"," human impact"," indigenous"," native American"," programming"," twine"],"image":"default.png","parents":[{"title":"Indigenous Representation & Presence in CS","subjects":"Computer Science, English, Science, History & Social Science","types":"Lesson Plan","grades":"4-8","tags":"tribal education, VTEC","contents":["./fry-bread.md","./chickahominy-land.md","./data-visualization-of-the-virginia-native-tribes.md","./go-show-the-world.md","./impacts-of-westward-expansion.md","./perspectives-on-the-dakota-access-pipeline.md","./rappahannock's-return-to-the-river.md","./remember.md","./treaties.md","./water-walker.md","./young-water-protectors.md"],"links":{"drive":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gBc8BCT4s1F7Pb6FTMLpka2NOa6UnX2D"},"pathData":{"exists":true,"path":"/vtec/meta.md"}}],"members":[]}}
